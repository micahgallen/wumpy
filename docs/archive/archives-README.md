Documents in this directory are preserved for historical context and are no longer considered authoritative for the current build. Review them when you need to understand past phases, earlier implementation details, or previous agent workflows.

## Contents
- `phase1/` — Phase 1 era summaries, implementation notes, and quick references (superseded by later combat systems work).
- `2025-11-04-review-docscombatxparchitecturemd-and-docsc.txt` — Claude session log capturing pre-phase-five planning context.

## Usage Guidelines
- Do not rely on archived files for active development decisions without confirming the information still applies.
- If you retire a document, move it here and append an “Archived” banner to the top of the file to explain why it was superseded.
