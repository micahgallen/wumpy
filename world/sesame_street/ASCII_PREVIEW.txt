  🎂  The cake is now 47% less likely to spontaneously ignite!  🎂
  🔥  Fire safety officers everywhere breathe a sigh of relief.  🔥
  🍰  The ambient temperature drops to merely "sauna-like."  🍰

Then the Muppet reactions appear:

Bert IMMEDIATELY stops pacing, clutches his clipboard to his chest,
and whispers "Thank the Department of Municipal Fire Safety..." with
visible tears in his eyes.

Cookie Monster yells "CAKE NOW SAFE TO EAT! ME VOLUNTEER FOR CAKE
DISPOSAL!" and lunges toward the cake with alarming speed.

Ernie looks disappointed and says "Aww, and I was just about to
suggest we add sparklers..." while sadly eating his marshmallow.

Big Bird cautiously approaches from the blast radius perimeter,
saying "Can someone tell Mr. Snuffleupagus it's safe to come back now?"

====================================================================

Everyone else in the room sees:

[Player Name] takes a deep breath and BLOWS OUT ALL FORTY CANDLES
in a single, heroic exhale!

💨 The force of wind is impressive. Several streamers flutter dramatically.
🔥 Forty tiny flames surrender simultaneously to the power of human lungs.
🌡️  The ambient temperature drops approximately 15 degrees.
📉 Local fire insurance premiums immediately decrease.
✨ The cake is now safe! (Relatively speaking.)

...followed by all the Muppet reactions above.
