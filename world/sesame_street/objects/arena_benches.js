  "description": "Wooden benches circle the arena in neat rows, their emptiness somehow louder than a crowd. They're worn smooth by generations of spectators who've come to watch combat and stayed for the existential crisis. Someone has carved 'I WAS HERE' into one bench, followed by another carving reading 'WHY THO'. The benches smell faintly of old popcorn and newer regrets. Despite their vacancy, they maintain an air of judgment, as if the seats themselves are disappointed in your life choices.",
