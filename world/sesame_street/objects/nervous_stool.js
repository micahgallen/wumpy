  "description": "This three-legged stool wobbles with the uncertainty of someone who's seen too much. Its legs are uneven - possibly by design, possibly by trauma. The seat bears the imprints of countless anxious pre-battle sitters, their nervous energy absorbed into the wood like bad memories into therapy. Sitting on it feels like a commitment to poor decisions, which is probably why it's here.",
