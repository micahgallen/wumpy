A small brass plaque reads: 'The Original Cookie - Preserved for Posterity (and Health Code Violations)'. You can't help but notice it still looks impossibly fresh. If you want cookies to eat, try looking around - some have been known to appear on the ground or can be purchased at Hooper's Store.",
