  "description": "This board tracks arena statistics with the kind of obsessive detail usually reserved for fantasy sports leagues run by people who've forgotten what sunlight looks like. Tally marks cover the surface in chaotic constellations: 'GRONK: 47 WINS', 'WUMPIES KICKED: 1,247', 'DIGNITY REMAINING: [blank]', 'EMOTIONAL DAMAGE: INCALCULABLE', 'DAYS SINCE LAST INCIDENT: 0'. Someone has started a betting pool called 'WILL TODAY BE THE DAY?' with surprisingly few takers. The handwriting suggests either multiple contributors or one person having a slow descent into madness.",
