  "description": "A massive three-tier birthday cake sits here, crowned with FORTY blazing candles that have collectively achieved what can only be described as 'controlled inferno' status. The frosting reads 'Happy 40th Birthday Texan!' in cheerful blue icing that's beginning to melt at an alarming rate. The cake itself appears to be chocolate, though it's hard to tell through the shimmering heat waves. Several nearby Muppets are maintaining what fire safety professionals would call 'a healthy respect distance.' You're fairly certain you can feel your eyebrows warming up just standing here.",

  "examine_text": "Upon closer inspection (and frankly, you're braver than most), this is clearly a professionally-made cake that someone has weaponized with FORTY candles. Each candle burns with the enthusiasm of a small sun. The frosting has developed several concerning drip patterns, and you notice scorch marks on the cake plate. A small fire extinguisher has been strategically placed nearby, presumably as a statement piece. The number '4-0' is emblazoned on the top tier in what might be silver fondant or might be melted aluminum - it's hard to tell at this temperature. You estimate the total thermal output at approximately 'one Swedish sauna' or 'half a dragon sneeze.'"
