  "description": "This ancient rotary telephone dangles from a chrome cord, humming with barely restrained dimensional energy. The dial shows destinations instead of numbers: Florida, Texas, Springfield, and several locations that aren't technically possible. The handset is warm to the touch and smells faintly of possibility and old coins.",
