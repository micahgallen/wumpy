  "description": "Glass jars of various sizes hold candy in colors that don't occur naturally in the visible spectrum. Each jar is labeled with names like 'Licorice Whips of Destiny', 'Jawbreakers of Moderate Regret', and 'Mystery Gummies (DO NOT EAT MORE THAN SEVEN)'. The prices haven't been updated since 1987, which is either charming or concerning.",
