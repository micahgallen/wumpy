  "description": "This rack has the energy of a participation trophy that's given up participating. It holds an assortment of training equipment in various states of denial about their functionality: a wooden practice sword that's more splinter than sword, some padding that's achieved the consistency of cardboard, and what might have once been a helmet but is now more of a 'decorative bowl with a tragic backstory.' A hand-written sign dangles from a nail: 'TAKE WHAT YOU NEED. LEAVE WHAT YOU VALUE. MANAGEMENT STOPPED CARING IN '03.'",
