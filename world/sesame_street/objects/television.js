  "description": "This TV is a magnificent relic of the CRT era, so thick it could serve as furniture or a defensive position. The remote is attached by a cable, suggesting a deep mistrust of guests. When turned on, it receives exactly three channels: static, more static, and what appears to be a cooking show from 1993 that may or may not be trapped in a time loop.",
