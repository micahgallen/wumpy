NoComplainIng about the RefEree (there is no referee). 4. Winners celebrate responsibly. 5. Losers do too, just quieter. 6. All combat is FINAL SALE, no refunds, exchanges, or existential complaints. 7. The Arena Champion is undefeated. Do with that information what you will. 8. Remember: It's not about winning or losing, it's about the enemies you make along the way.' Someone has added in different handwriting: 'Also, actual winning helps.'",
