  "description": "These stains have achieved a level of permanence usually reserved for childhood trauma and bad tattoos. They pattern the arena floor in abstract expressionism that's either very artistic or very concerning - possibly both. The colors range from 'rusty penny' to 'definitely not ketchup' to 'let's not ask questions.' Upon closer inspection, some of the stains appear to be shaped like Wumpies, which is either coincidence or the universe's way of keeping score. A small note pinned nearby reads: 'CLEANING CREW GAVE UP - YEAR UNKNOWN.'",
