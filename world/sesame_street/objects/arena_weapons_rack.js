  "description": "An impressive display of implements designed for percussive diplomacy. The rack holds training weapons in surprisingly good condition - wooden swords that still remember being trees, practice spears with the reach of disappointment, and several objects whose original purpose has been lost to time but whose current purpose is 'hit things with this end.' A small plaque reads: 'FOR DISPLAY PURPOSES ONLY. Or actual combat. We're not your mother.' The weapons gleam in the arena light with the enthusiasm of tools that love their job a little too much.",
