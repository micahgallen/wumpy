  "description": "Ernie lounges here with the relaxed confidence of someone who has never read a fire safety manual. He's got a party hat at a jaunty angle and is holding what appears to be a toasting marshmallow on a stick, which he's holding dangerously close to the candles. His grin suggests he finds Bert's panic absolutely delightful.",

    "Hey there! Great party, huh? Bert thinks the cake is 'too hot' but I think it's just right for roasting marshmallows!",
    "Happy birthday, Texan! You know what they say - the bigger the fire hazard, the better the party!",
    "Bert's been timing how long he can stand near the cake. His current record is twelve seconds!",
    "I tried to add a few MORE candles but Bert physically wrestled them out of my hands. It was pretty funny!",
    "Don't worry about Bert. He said the same thing about my 'experimental fireworks' last year and THAT turned out... okay, bad example.",
    "The cake is fine! Probably! I mean, the local birds are using it as a heat source but that's just efficient energy use!",
    "Shh, watch this - I'm gonna suggest lighting sparklers. Bert's eye is already twitching!"
