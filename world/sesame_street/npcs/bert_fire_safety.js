  "description": "Bert stands here wearing an improvised fire marshal vest made from orange construction paper. He's clutching a clipboard and eyeing the birthday cake with the kind of anxiety usually reserved for active volcanoes. His unibrow has achieved new levels of concerned furrowing. Every few seconds he mutters calculations about BTUs and flashpoint temperatures.",

    "FORTY candles, Ernie. FORTY. That's not a birthday cake, that's a fire code violation with frosting!",
    "I've already filled out three incident reports and he hasn't even blown them out yet!",
    "Happy birthday, Texan! Please blow out those candles before I have to file paperwork in triplicate!",
    "Do you know what the recommended maximum candle density is? Because we are SIGNIFICANTLY over that threshold!",
    "I'm not being paranoid, I'm being PREPARED. There's a difference! Also, is it getting hot in here?",
    "Ernie said I was 'overreacting.' OVERREACTING. The cake is literally creating its own weather system!",
    "At least Big Bird is keeping a safe distance. SOMEONE around here understands thermal dynamics."
