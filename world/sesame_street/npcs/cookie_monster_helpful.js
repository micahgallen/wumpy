  "description": "Cookie Monster stands here wearing a tiny firefighter helmet that's comically small on his fuzzy blue head. He's holding what he claims is 'emergency cake disposal equipment' but looks suspiciously like just a very large fork and napkin. His eyes are locked on the birthday cake with the intense focus of a very hungry predator. Small amounts of drool are visible.",
