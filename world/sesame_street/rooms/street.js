  "description": "You stand at the heart of Sesame Street, which has been transformed into what can only be described as 'enthusiastic chaos with streamers.' Colorful balloons are EVERYWHERE - taped to lampposts, tied to trash cans, and floating ominously at eye level. A massive banner reading 'HAPPY 40TH BIRTHDAY TEXAN!' stretches across the plaza, slightly crooked, suggesting either artistic intent or a ladder-related incident. In the center of everything sits THE CAKE - a three-tier chocolate masterpiece crowned with FORTY blazing candles that have collectively achieved 'bonfire' status. The ambient temperature has risen noticeably. Bert paces nearby with a clipboard, occasionally pointing at fire code violations. Ernie is roasting marshmallows. Cookie Monster is vibrating with barely-contained cake enthusiasm. Big Bird has wisely moved to the edge of the blast radius. The sun shines with its usual dedication, but honestly, the candles are doing most of the illumination work now. The general store to the east and tavern to the west remain accessible, though you notice both establishments have their sprinkler systems on standby.",
