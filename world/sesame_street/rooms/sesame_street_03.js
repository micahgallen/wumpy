  "description": "Here the street achieves peak wholesomeness, with window boxes overflowing with flowers that bloom in defiance of season, logic, and botanical taxonomy. A fire hydrant painted to look like a smiling dalmatian sits at the curb, somehow both charming and vaguely unsettling. The pavement sparkles as if someone has been aggressively power-washing away anything that might constitute reality.",
