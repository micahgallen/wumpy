  "description": "The room embodies 'adequate' with a passion bordering on art form. A bed of ambiguous comfort squats against one wall, covered in a quilt featuring geometric patterns that induce mild hypnosis. The wallpaper depicts repeating scenes of clouds that are either peaceful or deeply menacing depending on your current state of mind. A mirror on the wall reflects you with unflinching honesty.",
