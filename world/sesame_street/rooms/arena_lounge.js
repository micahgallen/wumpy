  "description": "You've descended into what can only be described as 'aggressively atmospheric.' The walls are covered in chalk tally marks of dubious accuracy, and the floor bears scuff marks from nervous pacing. A battered equipment rack leans against one wall like it's given up on life but hasn't figured out how to quit. Through a southern archway, you can hear the distant echoes of enthusiastic violence and the occasional disappointed 'wump.' A faded sign on the wall reads: 'MANAGEMENT NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DIGNITY LOSS, WUMPY-RELATED INJURIES, OR SUDDEN REALIZATIONS ABOUT YOUR LIFE CHOICES.'",
