  "description": "The cheerful yellow bricks of Sesame Street begin here, though they seem to fade uncertainly toward the south where shadows gather with intent. The air smells of fresh-baked cookies and optimism, fighting a losing battle against something darker just beyond your peripheral vision. A faded welcome sign cheerfully insists this is 'The Friendliest Street in America!' - the exclamation point looks nervous.",
