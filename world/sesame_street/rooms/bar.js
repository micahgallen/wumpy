  "description": "The tavern manages to be simultaneously wholesome and questionable, with sticky tables that have witnessed a thousand philosophical debates and probably a few minor crimes. Peanut shells crunch underfoot with satisfying authority. The bar itself is a magnificent slab of oak that could double as a life raft or a shield wall, currently serving its more important purpose of dispensing liquid courage and regret.",
