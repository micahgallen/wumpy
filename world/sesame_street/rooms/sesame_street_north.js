  "description": "The street reaches its northern terminus in a cul-de-sac of aggressive cheerfulness. A bright red telephone booth stands here like a portal to anywhere else, its chrome gleaming with promises of escape and adventure. The buildings seem to lean in conspiratorially, as if they know something you don't. A gentle breeze carries the scent of crayons and possibility.",
