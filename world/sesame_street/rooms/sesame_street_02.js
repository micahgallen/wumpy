  "description": "The street widens here into a pleasant boulevard lined with suspiciously perfect lampposts that have never seen a burned-out bulb. Colorful hopscotch squares are chalked onto the pavement with geometrical precision that suggests either obsessive dedication or the work of a very exacting child. You can hear the distant sound of a kazoo having an identity crisis.",
