================================================================================
                            DESIGN NOTES
================================================================================

SESAME STREET THEME: Satirical 90s nostalgia meets Terry Pratchett wit. Wholesome with subtle darkness.
REALITY STREET THEME: A satirical take on gritty 80s/90s urban decay, inspired by movies like the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The aesthetic is one of analog grime and street-level realism. The world is characterized by graffiti-covered brick walls, steam rising from manholes, and the flickering neon of a seedy arcade. The humor is dark and cynical, grounded in the absurdity of city life, with its inhabitants ranging from wise-cracking vermin to disgruntled cabbies and petty thugs. It's a place where the biggest challenges are navigating the treacherous alleys and outsmarting the locals.

EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES:
- Sesame: Additional hotel rooms, back rooms for bar/store, alleyways.
- Reality: The Condemned Park can be fully built out. More tenements to explore. A sewer system accessible from the abandoned subway. A rival street gang's turf.
